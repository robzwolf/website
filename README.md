This is a Jekyll personal portfolio website hosted on Netlify.

Based on [MLH-Fellowship/portfolio-template](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/portfolio-template).

## Add Cards to the Portfolio

Head to `_data` and fill out `volunteering.yml`, `employment.yml` and `education.yml`.

Volunteering example.
```yaml
- role: Lead Organiser
  company: DurHack
  dates: March 2017 – December 2019
  logo: dh.svg
  class: dh
```

employment example.
```yaml
- role: Junior PHP Developer
  company: Komodo Digital
  dates: September 2018 – August 2019

```

Education example.

### Styles and Images
Add classes to `_sass/cards.scss` to style cards. Class names match the `class` YAML attribute on cards.

Add images to `assets/img/*`, where `*` is the respective directory for `volunteering`, `education` or `employment`.
